-- The tv_shows table contains only one record where title = Dexter (but the id can be different)
-- Each record should display: tv_genres.name
-- Results must be sorted in ascending order by the genre name
-- You can use a maximum of two SELECT statement
-- The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command
